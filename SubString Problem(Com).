You can perform following two operation on S any number of times(possibly zero).
1). Remove first character from S
2).Remove last character from S

find total number of distinct non-empty strings that can be generated

CODE:

def count_distinct_substrings(s):
    n = len(s)
    return n * (n + 1) // 2 - 1

# Example usage
s = "abc"
result = count_distinct_substrings(s)
print(f"Total number of distinct non-empty substrings: {result}")
